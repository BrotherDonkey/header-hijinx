            <h1>I'm about to go to the store</h1>
            <p>As it turns out, I'm a man who quite like to have a few beers in the evening. It's a very unique idea I agree. Is this what you call a ... personality? Whatever your chosen word for it, I've been know to chuck one or two back in the evening, so there I was lazing on the couch, thinking about a beer. There wasn't any in the fridge, and I figured there was only option. Seattle had finally seen its first glimpse of spring, and because of that the sky was bright with only dappled clouds and the sun was just going down around 9PM. Not a bad time to venture forth. Being a man who helps himself harm himself, I got myself up and said goodbye to the apartment. Goodbye apartment!.</p>
            <p>Noctural by nature, whether by choice or slavery to a screen, there should be no surprise that I am generally lacking in vitamin D. The natural light was a bit of a shock to the system, although I did eventually get over it. Ah, the great outdoors, I thought as I saw a dog pooping on the patch of grass in front of my building, while the owner, a gaunt fellow full beard, stood wearily to the side with a bag in his hand.</p>
            <p>Any good yuppy can tell you that Hole Foods has beer. It was the only choice really, except for any of the other three supermarkets or corner stores within a five minute walk. These other places didn't let you scan a QR code on your phone to get 1.2 cents off your potato chips. Their cashiers certainly didn't say "Thanks for being a Dime Member." This feeling of inclusion just makes me feel so nice. All this and nothing more went through my head as I stepped towards the watering Hole.</p>
            <p>Fuck sake, I thought, they're closed. Alright, alright, nothing to worry about here. There was a corner shop not too far away; it was an immigrant run place, super nice. They worked damn hard, open until eleven for sure. Why didn't I just go there in the first place? Oh, yes, the QR code, I remembered.</p>
            <p>Get the hell on with it, I thought to myself.</p>
